# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

## Link to Trello
Everything done in the repository should be linked with a card in the 
[Trello](https://trello.com/b/0vQrnCYi/leafraison). If no related card exists
create it before starting anything.

## Branch workflow
Before you start writing code, you **should create a new branch** for your
contribution. 
 - The name of your branch should be a shorter version of your
card title. 
 - All names should be lowercase and words separated by dashes `-`.

### Example: 
```
Card's title: Create a contribution guide [Github].
Branch name: contribution-guide
```

*After your first push to the repository, you can add a link to your branch
in the related card.*

## Push and Merge
Once your code is working and you have completed the card goal: it is time to 
merge your branch.
 - Your code should be running **before pushing it** !
 - You need to insert a link to the Trello card in your pull request.
 - Your request should be reviewed and approved by **2 different members** before
merging.

> Once the merge is done, the branch is deleted.
