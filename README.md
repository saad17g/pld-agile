Welcome to LeafRaison software, allowing you to assign requests to you couriers and to compute tours for each courier.

The Software Interface decomposes in 3 parts:

- The one on the left is the operating area, where you can find a menu, or a list of buttons. These buttons play a crucial role as service callers, they correspond exactly to the functional requirements of the software.
- The center view will display the loaded map and the computed tours, this is the main part of the application.
- The right view is the information view, containing all the requests and a message box that will guides you through the use of the application.

You can execute the software through 2 distincts ways:

- By directly executing the file LeafRaison.jar
- By executing the code through an IDE (we advise IntelliJ). P.S: you may need to download all the dependancies listed in LeafRaison.iml

Enjoy LeafRaison ðŸŒ¿!
